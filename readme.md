  This web application asks users to enter a specific phrase within a predetermined window of time in order to periodically check if they are still alive and responsive.
  
  The application sends a notification to a Discord webhook, if the
            user does not enter the target phrase within the set time. If this
            happens, the application will assume that the user may be in trouble
            or is unresponsive.
