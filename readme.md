  This application asks users to enter a specific phrase within a predetermined window of time in order to periodically check if they are still alive and responsive. The application sends a notification to a Discord webhook, if the user does not enter the target phrase within the set time. If this happens, the application assumes that the user may be in trouble or unresponsive.
